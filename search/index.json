He told us to use the best existing public notebooks, and see how we could improve on any one solution. While to be honest I don\u0026rsquo;t completely see what the purpose of it would be for us, it was nonetheless interesting as I\u0026rsquo;ve always wanted to try my hand at Competitive Programming(-adjacent) problems.\nNavaratri, a Traditional Hindu Festival Khush, whom we met that day, told us about the festival as we were having dinner together alongside Esther, KM, and Fir. Sadly KM had to leave early but for the rest of us we had travelled to go see it via Grab. It was surprisingly cheap at ~25 baht per person (approx. S$1) especially considering that we had to travel all the way to the city area as the festival was held in Silom, taking around 35 minutes. To be fair\u0026hellip; it was split amongst 4 people but still\u0026hellip; unheard of in Singapore.\nThe festival lasts 9 nights, and we had caught it on its final day on Thursday (October 2nd). It was wayyy more packed than I had expected, and in fact more packed last year, according to Khush. It was a very lively celebration indeed, with many of the audience cheerfully chanting to one of the performers balancing a heavy pot (matka) on their heads.\nWe had to spend a lot of time walking on the curb of the other street which wasn\u0026rsquo;t blocked off for traffic (as the main street was packed to the brim and there were no proper sidewalks there), and it felt pretty dangerous as the cars were passsing by right next to us; perhaps they hadn\u0026rsquo;t anticipated such a massive turnout, there was a lot of traffic jams due to people crossing the road.\nOverall, it was really fun and by the end I got to see quite a few different gods and also got to do a offering to one of the many shrines on the side of the road. I found myself completely drenched in sweat due to the humidity from the rain the day before, yet also weirdly energised. By the time we got back, it was already 11PM and I made sure to take a good long shower in order to freshen up.\n","date":"2025-10-06T10:02:15.191Z","image":"https://sensura-san.github.io/silly-blog/p/fourth-week/cover_hu_59aca2900ee55a3e.png","permalink":"https://sensura-san.github.io/silly-blog/p/fourth-week/","title":"Week 4: Code golfing for the advancement of AI"},{"content":"Project Update For simplicity, I came up with a different approach of web scraping from Google Scholar by using SerpAPI. I only called the API once and save it as markdown which the texts will then be uploaded to the Publication Page. Using markdown in the Ghost website builder allows future editors to add in publications with ease.\nEditing in Ghost website builder is not only simple but also rich in content editing. It is a useful website for both developers and content editors to update or generate posts.\n","date":"2025-10-06T10:02:15.191Z","image":"https://sensura-san.github.io/silly-blog/p/fifth-week/cover-n16_hu_17baca54d76108db.jpg","permalink":"https://sensura-san.github.io/silly-blog/p/fifth-week/","title":"Week 5: Grinding Projects"},{"content":"Exploring Projects Andreaa and I had an opportunity to explore different kinds of projects. One of it is to collaborate with the full-time students and work on their capstone projects. KM, one of the full-time student suggest to us that Andreaa and I can cotribute to his one of his projects which is Audio-Language Models which involves a mixture of AI and cybersecurity. To elaborate further, KM\u0026rsquo;s project is mainly focus on the frequency of the Audio Language Models that converts from audio to text. He used that to determine if the prompts are able to bypass the model\u0026rsquo;s safeguard and produce harmful responses.\nProject Updates After getting familiar with the Ghost website builder, Andreaa and I fixed the responsiveness of the IC2 Website. We also seeked guidance from KM for the publication sources that was web-scraped using python.\n","date":"2025-09-21T10:02:15.191Z","image":"https://sensura-san.github.io/silly-blog/p/second-week/cover2_hu_98af2fe4ac0a811b.jpg","permalink":"https://sensura-san.github.io/silly-blog/p/second-week/","title":"Week 2: in Bangkok for our KMUTT Internship"},{"content":"For my 3-month internship, I decided to choose one that was abroad as I wanted to learn from people with experiences that I\u0026rsquo;d never find in Singapore. Little did I know, during my first week of internship abroad in interning at King Mongkutâ€™s University of Technology Thonburi (KMUTT) in Thailand, I\u0026rsquo;d be utterly blown away.\nOur time in BKK After being introduced around, I\u0026rsquo;ve gotten a bit more familiarised with the school\u0026rsquo;s environment and the local culture. I\u0026rsquo;ve explored the surrounding area with my roommate and new friend Firdaus, who has been very proactive in finding new places for us. he has also been a good teammate, being very receptive to my advice and my ideas for working together on projects, and has collaborated greatly so far on brainstorming for new ideas.\nSo far, I\u0026rsquo;ve met a few people who\u0026rsquo;ve helped me greatly in getting integrated into the environment, like my supervisor Dr. Jonathan H. Chan, Professor Chonlameth, and IC2 student KM. Their knowledge has been beneficial to me; for example Dr. Chonlameth helped introduce me to some student projects, while Dr. Jonathan helped give me a run down on what I\u0026rsquo;m supposed to do.\nLearning about Projects From the students, Firdaus and I learnt about AI-related projects (which we may be assigned to), such as a makeup recommender that recommends foundation based on skin colour, and contour based on face shape \u0026ndash; which used YOLOv12 to classify face shapes. It also used facial segmentation image models to apply a filter (e.g. foundation, blush) in order to preview the makeup. Another project was that of an AI FAQ chatbot for the school which used RAG. in both, we learnt a bit about the tech stack used for the projects, like how certain services were containerised, and how they were used; this gave me a bit of insight into different architectures and how to set them up depending on the scope of our project.\nKM covered a few of his projects (and those of other students): a time-series regression model to create synthetic data for market conditions (e.g. bull/bear conditions), a past climate change robot \u0026ndash; that used LLMs to spread awareness, and his current research project which is about developing a unified audio purification model/framework for (Large) Audio Language Models [(L)ALMs] to defend from attacks meant to cause a large language model (LLM) to operate in an unintended way (e.g. by bypassing guardrails). The LALM project was still in the research phase, covering research within the past few years on the topic, and how they weren\u0026rsquo;t unified \u0026ndash; the current purification models were only meant to defend against attacks for one particular type of model, like a classification or speech-to-text model. They were very interesting as KM is a very technical person by nature, and the slides he presents were very detailed, covering the exact methodology and machine learning techniques used.\nKM has a deep interest in AI topics and has read up on many papers, so his deep experience with the topic makes me feel like an apprentice to a master in his craft \u0026ndash; I\u0026rsquo;m able to learn a lot more about the nitty gritty details of topics that I was only previously acquainted with from him. His deep understanding of the technology involved really shines through, being able to effortlessly explain complex topics in a simple and concise manner.\nIn general, his deep understanding of the technology involved \u0026ndash; gained through his interest and research into papers regarding artificial intelligence, really shines through when giving presentations; he is able to effortlessly explain complex topics in a concise and understandable manner, making him a joy to learn from and to ask questions to.\nOur work We were told by Dr. Jonathan to brainstorm some possible ideas and solutions for our projects, and we were assigned a few things that we could work on \u0026ndash; for example, updating the website for the IC2 Research Center, or refining a robot that IC2 has been worked on for a previous hackathon.\nFor now, I have just started brainstorming and taking notes on the projects, and any new knowledge that comes my way. In the meantime, I\u0026rsquo;ve set up this very blog and added some features that we would need (like the Author section, which wasn\u0026rsquo;t in the template).\nI\u0026rsquo;ve also learnt a few new things about AI, like how LALMs don\u0026rsquo;t actually have intermediate steps in converting audio input to text output (as opposed to first captioning the audio and passing it into the model), and even a bit about how to read candlestick graphs \u0026ndash; which is useful in understanding stock graphs.\nExploring the area Unlike Singapore which has been forced into verticality due to its limited land area, Bangkok is held up to no such restriction. The high-rises and skyscrapers quickly disappear from my periphery as I take the bus away from the city, and it\u0026rsquo;s instead replaced with shorter, less fanciful yet just-as-practical buildings \u0026ndash; looking similar to many Southeast Asian countries.\nBesides that, me and Firdaus explored our surroundings; going to malls in the city area and finding tasty spots around the KMUTT. The path to the mall was intertwined with their rail system with a dizzying amount of verticality, with shops integrating into the rail exits integrating into mall entrances, creating an almost cyberpunk-like feel. There was also much more life and variety in the malls; shops owned by both large chains and small businesses co-existed \u0026ndash; a stark contrast with Singapore\u0026rsquo;s, where rent in large malls (often owned by Capitaland) are too unsustainable for small businesses, pushing them to smaller, less fancy malls at the fringe.\nNot to mention, food here has been both delicious and cheap, with the meals of some days only totalling up to 140 baht (~ S$5.60) \u0026ndash; and that\u0026rsquo;s with both drinks and dessert!\nMessage of the Week (i.e. Conclusion) I\u0026rsquo;m grateful that I took this opportunity to leave my comfort zone and to have an internship overseas, seeing as how I\u0026rsquo;ve been able to learn so much and experience things that I would never have the chance to in Singapore. The enthusiasm of the people around me in their course of study and fueled my desire to strive to better myself in AI, and I hope to continue learning and working with my new-found friends.\n","date":"2025-09-07T00:00:00Z","image":"https://sensura-san.github.io/silly-blog/p/first-week/cover_hu_632e0de369ad165a.jpg","permalink":"https://sensura-san.github.io/silly-blog/p/first-week/","title":"First week in Bangkok for our KMUTT Internship"}]
