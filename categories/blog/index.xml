&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;For our first stop, we went to Chinatown after our KMITL visit (see prev. post~). After a long bus ride from our lab which took almost an hour (note: avoid Bangkok traffic on Friday..), we entered Chinatown and headed to the Kuan Yim Shrine which is Mahayana Buddhist, to offer some prayers. I sort of only did one and gave up because I was too sleepy, though KM and Khush did properly do the whole three rites.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Afterwards, we headed off for our well-deserved dinner; KM had a place in mind and took the scariest, most long-winded path known to man to reach it. We were joking that he would kidnap us by bringing down a weird alleyway, so when we actually started heading down one, I found myself lowkey concerned&amp;hellip; Anyway, we ended up at a Michelin Bib Gourmand-rated restaurant (surprisingly many in Thailand btw) called Kuay Teow Kua Kai Suan Mali, which served Kuey Teow but fried into a crispy almost pancake-like dish.&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Honestly, I had pretty high expectations of the food quality as I noticed that: a), place was down a dingy alleyway, b), the menu was super tiny, and c), I mean come on its rated by Michelin. Why a) and b) though you may asK? Well, if a restaurant can look run-down yet have loads of customers then the food definitely would make up for it, and if they only make one thing, they&amp;rsquo;d better be pretty damn good at at! And indeed, it was more than above my expectations; when we order the Kuey Teow the skin was delightfully crispy and onsen eggs were absolutely perfect. In a way the fried Kuey Teow skin almost tasted like prata for some reason. Prices were very reasonable too, at 50 THB for small or 60 THB for the large, which is around 2 dollars for them. I uh, had two bowls&amp;hellip; and would&amp;rsquo;ve gotten more if I didn&amp;rsquo;t feel kinda unwell&amp;hellip;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We wrapped up with Khush heading back himself as he lived in the area, whilst the rest of us took a bus back to our dorms to get a good night&amp;rsquo;s rest and prepare for our final day of our internship, and our second last day in thailand~&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;My manager, an undergrad, Andreaa, and I set off for King Mongkut&amp;rsquo;s Institute of Technology Ladkrabang (KMITL) to meet Professor Kitsuchart Pasupa and get a behind-the-scenes look at the SIT campus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We all gathered at Hua Lamphong Railway Station, thanks to my manager’s idea to hop on an old-school train for the full experience. The station itself was massive—seriously, it felt like stepping into a time machine with all the retro vibes.

&lt;figcaption&gt;Hua Lamphong Railway Station&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After strolling through the main entrance, we spotted two trains on display. Not gonna lie, it totally gave off movie vibes—like Mr. Bean’s Holiday with all the chaos at Gare de Lyon in Paris, or those iconic Harry Potter moments at King’s Cross in London. It was a mashup of cinematic nostalgia! And get this—the train fare from Hua Lamphong to KMITL was just 6 Baht. Absolute bargain!

&lt;h2 id="kmitl"&gt;KMITL
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;When we finally arrived at KMITL, we grabbed some lunch before meeting the professors. At the SIT building, students were busy setting up booths for the Open House—which, sadly, was happening the next day, not today&amp;hellip;😭&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;Peace Yo&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once both professors showed up, our campus tour kicked off. The building was pretty unique—six floors, tight hallways, and rooms everywhere you looked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the fourth floor, we stumbled into a game dev room sponsored by Metaverse. There were VR headsets everywhere and some gear that looked like it belonged in a sci-fi movie—think “VR space walk.” Super cool!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also checked out Professor Kitsuchart Pasupa’s lab to see one of the workstations they use for AI model testing. Fun fact: their “extra” air cooler was just a standing fan!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Andreaa and I spent the day at the IC2 Lab finalizing deliverables, handing over documentation, and presenting our final updates to the manager. We reviewed outstanding tasks, ensured knowledge transfer, and confirmed next steps before signing off.&lt;/p&gt;

Professor Jonathan stopped by and brought a cake for everyone; we shared stories, took photos, and thanked everyone for their support. It was a warm, uplifting send‑off that left us proud of what we accomplished and excited for what’s next.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;This week has been an absolute whirlwind! Andreaa and I took a deep dive into downtown Bangkok, determined to tick a major item off our bucket list: the legendary Auntie Nid Thai Tea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We arrived to find a massive queue—we’re talking a solid one-hour wait. Thankfully, the shop knows their crowd; they had a line of chairs set up so we didn&amp;rsquo;t have to stand in the heat. But was it worth the wait?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Absolutely. The shocking part wasn&amp;rsquo;t the line; it was the price. For just 1.68 SGD, we got a drink that completely lived up to the hype. Sweet, creamy, and incredibly affordable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the tea, we decided to explore the vibrant streets near Chulalongkorn University. This area is buzzing with young adults and is packed with dozens of trendy cafes and restaurants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We stumbled upon a total hidden gem called Ice Cream Somasorn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s a dedicated dessert cafe that takes sundaes to the next level. We couldn&amp;rsquo;t resist ordering their best-sellers:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Banana Crème Brûlée:&lt;/strong&gt; Perfectly caramelized and smooth.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kopi Tiramisu:&lt;/strong&gt; A rich, coffee-infused delight that hit the spot.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;The craving for a solid Western meal hit us hard today. While wandering near KMUTT, we were stopped in our tracks by a massive, unmissable bear mascot standing guard outside a storefront. Driven by hunger and curiosity, we decided to check it out.

&lt;p&gt;But the real showstopper? The salad bar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They offer a fantastic variety of fresh greens and toppings. And here is the best part: it’s free-flow. (Note: The unlimited salad bar is complimentary when you order specific main dishes, so check the menu first!)

&lt;p&gt;I decided to go big and ordered the Chicken Burger. &amp;ldquo;Huge&amp;rdquo; is an understatement—this thing was a tower! It came paired with onion rings that were fried to golden perfection—crispy on the outside, tender on the inside, and completely addictive.

&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;This week, Professor Jonathan introduced us to &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/google-code-golf-2025/overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
&gt;NeurIPS 2025&lt;/a&gt;, a code golf championship intended to create a dataset to improve the performance of LLMs on novel problems. He told us to use the best existing public notebooks, and see how we could improve on any one solution. While to be honest I don&amp;rsquo;t completely see what the purpose of it would be for us, it was nonetheless interesting as I&amp;rsquo;ve always wanted to try my hand at Competitive Programming(-adjacent) problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="navaratri-a-traditional-hindu-festival"&gt;Navaratri, a Traditional Hindu Festival
&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;Khush, whom we met that day, told us about the festival as we were having dinner together alongside Esther, KM, and Fir. Sadly KM had to leave early but for the rest of us we had travelled to go see it via Grab. It was surprisingly cheap at ~25 baht per person (approx. S$1) especially considering that we had to travel all the way to the city area as the festival was held in Silom, taking around 35 minutes. To be fair&amp;hellip; it was split amongst 4 people but still&amp;hellip; unheard of in Singapore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The festival lasts 9 nights, and we had caught it on its final day on Thursday (October 2nd). It was wayyy more packed than I had expected, and in fact more packed last year, according to Khush. It was a very lively celebration indeed, with many of the audience cheerfully chanting to one of the performers balancing a heavy pot (matka) on their heads.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We had to spend a lot of time walking on the curb of the other street which wasn&amp;rsquo;t blocked off for traffic (as the main street was packed to the brim and there were no proper sidewalks there), and it felt pretty dangerous as the cars were passsing by right next to us; perhaps they hadn&amp;rsquo;t anticipated such a massive turnout, there was a lot of traffic jams due to people crossing the road.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, it was really fun and by the end I got to see quite a few different gods and also got to do a offering to one of the many shrines on the side of the road. I found myself completely drenched in sweat due to the humidity from the rain the day before, yet also weirdly energised. By the time we got back, it was already 11PM and I made sure to take a good long shower in order to freshen up.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Week 3: Artifical Intelligence and such</title><link>https://sensura-san.github.io/silly-blog/p/third-week/</link><pubDate>Fri, 03 Oct 2025 13:10:27 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sensura-san.github.io/silly-blog/p/third-week/</guid><description>&lt;img src="https://sensura-san.github.io/silly-blog/p/third-week/cover2.jpg" alt="Featured image of post Week 3: Artifical Intelligence and such" /&gt;&lt;h1 id="project-update"&gt;Project Update

&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;We decided to upgrade to a larger room and asked the dorm receptionist about availability. Luckily, there was an open unit that was noticeably bigger than our current place. The price is quite reasonable as the total rent cost for one month for this room is 18000 Baht(roughly 730.23 SGD ) which is an additional 6000 Baht per month from our previous room.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We went for a tour and were pleasantly surprised by how much more spacious it felt — a larger living area, a roomier bedroom, and extra storage that made it easy to separate sleeping, working, and relaxing zones. It immediately felt like a meaningful upgrade in comfort and functionality.&lt;/p&gt;

alt="Room view"
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="living-room"&gt;Living Room
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The living room includes a compact kitchenette with a small kitchen table and a dining table placed right beside the study area. That setup makes it easy to work or eat in the living room while keeping the bedroom as a separate, private space. The dining table also doubles as an extra workspace when needed, giving us more surface area and flexibility without crowding the study. The toilet and study table was pretty much the same as last time. Well at least we can work from home!&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="bedroom"&gt;Bedroom
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though the bedroom layout gives a familiar “hey, remember this?” vibe from our old place, the upgrade is obvious — we finally have our own closet! Andrea’s side comes with a cheerful stack of shelves that’s already hosting plants, notebooks, snack reserves, and a suspiciously large sock collection. The closet eats my luggage like a polite little black hole and has extra shelves for shoes, boxes, and all those chargers that used to roam free. A string of fairy lights and a cozy rug turned the corner into a tiny chill nook — same cozy bedroom energy, but with actual storage and instant bragging rights.&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And since we have our own closet, this time its much more bigger. I can even fit my luggage inside! Additionally, there are several shelves inside the closet to put bunch of your stuff there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="balcony"&gt;Balcony
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the most interesting part is our balcony — we’ve got an unobstructed view of the city that completely changes how the place feels. It’s big enough for a small bistro set, so mornings are now for coffee and people-watching, and evenings are for winding down with the skyline. The railing gives a clear sightline without feeling exposed, and a soft string of lights makes it a cosy spot after dark.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;Andreaa and I had an opportunity to explore different kinds of projects. One of it is to collaborate with the full-time students and work on their capstone projects. KM, one of the full-time student suggest to us that Andreaa and I can cotribute to his one of his projects which is Audio-Language Models which involves a mixture of AI and cybersecurity. To elaborate further, KM&amp;rsquo;s project is mainly focus on the frequency of the Audio Language Models that converts from audio to text. He used that to determine if the prompts are able to bypass the model&amp;rsquo;s safeguard and produce harmful responses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="project-updates"&gt;Project Updates
&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;After getting familiar with the Ghost website builder, Andreaa and I fixed the responsiveness of the IC2 Website. We also seeked guidance from KM for the publication sources that was web-scraped using python.&lt;/p&gt;

Little did I know, during my first week of internship abroad in interning at King Mongkut’s University of Technology Thonburi (KMUTT) in Thailand, I&amp;rsquo;d be utterly blown away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="our-time-in-bkk"&gt;Our time in BKK
&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;After being introduced around, I&amp;rsquo;ve gotten a bit more familiarised with the school&amp;rsquo;s environment and the local culture. I&amp;rsquo;ve explored the surrounding area with my roommate and new friend Firdaus, who has been very proactive in finding new places for us. he has also been a good teammate, being very receptive to my advice and my ideas for working together on projects, and has collaborated greatly so far on brainstorming for new ideas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far, I&amp;rsquo;ve met a few people who&amp;rsquo;ve helped me greatly in getting integrated into the environment, like my supervisor Dr. Jonathan H. Chan, Professor Chonlameth, and IC2 student KM. Their knowledge has been beneficial to me; for example Dr. Chonlameth helped introduce me to some student projects, while Dr. Jonathan helped give me a run down on what I&amp;rsquo;m supposed to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="learning-about-projects"&gt;Learning about Projects
&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;From the students, Firdaus and I learnt about AI-related projects (which we may be assigned to), such as a makeup recommender that recommends foundation based on skin colour, and contour based on face shape &amp;ndash; which used YOLOv12 to classify face shapes. It also used facial segmentation image models to apply a filter (e.g. foundation, blush) in order to preview the makeup. Another project was that of an AI FAQ chatbot for the school which used RAG. in both, we learnt a bit about the tech stack used for the projects, like how certain services were containerised, and how they were used; this gave me a bit of insight into different architectures and how to set them up depending on the scope of our project.&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;KM covered a few of his projects (and those of other students): a time-series regression model to create synthetic data for market conditions (e.g. bull/bear conditions), a past climate change robot &amp;ndash; that used LLMs to spread awareness, and his current research project which is about developing a unified audio purification model/framework for (Large) Audio Language Models [(L)ALMs] to defend from attacks meant to cause a large language model (LLM) to operate in an unintended way (e.g. by bypassing guardrails). The LALM project was still in the research phase, covering research within the past few years on the topic, and how they weren&amp;rsquo;t unified &amp;ndash; the current purification models were &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; meant to defend against attacks for one particular type of model, like a classification or speech-to-text model. They were very interesting as KM is a very technical person by nature, and the slides he presents were very detailed, covering the exact methodology and machine learning techniques used.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;KM has a deep interest in AI topics and has read up on many papers, so his deep experience with the topic makes me feel like an apprentice to a master in his craft &amp;ndash; I&amp;rsquo;m able to learn a lot more about the nitty gritty details of topics that I was only previously acquainted with from him. His deep understanding of the technology involved really shines through, being able to effortlessly explain complex topics in a simple and concise manner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In general, his deep understanding of the technology involved &amp;ndash; gained through his interest and research into papers regarding artificial intelligence, really shines through when giving presentations; he is able to effortlessly explain complex topics in a concise and understandable manner, making him a joy to learn from and to ask questions to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="our-work"&gt;Our work
&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;We were told by Dr. Jonathan to brainstorm some possible ideas and solutions for our projects, and we were assigned a few things that we could work on &amp;ndash; for example, updating the website for the IC2 Research Center, or refining a robot that IC2 has been worked on for a previous hackathon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For now, I have just started brainstorming and taking notes on the projects, and any new knowledge that comes my way. In the meantime, I&amp;rsquo;ve set up this very blog and added some features that we would need (like the Author section, which wasn&amp;rsquo;t in the template).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve also learnt a few new things about AI, like how LALMs don&amp;rsquo;t actually have intermediate steps in converting audio input to text output (as opposed to first captioning the audio and passing it into the model), and even a bit about how to read candlestick graphs &amp;ndash; which is useful in understanding stock graphs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unlike Singapore which has been forced into verticality due to its limited land area, Bangkok is held up to no such restriction. The high-rises and skyscrapers quickly disappear from my periphery as I take the bus away from the city, and it&amp;rsquo;s instead replaced with shorter, less fanciful yet just-as-practical buildings &amp;ndash; looking similar to many Southeast Asian countries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Besides that, me and Firdaus explored our surroundings; going to malls in the city area and finding tasty spots around the KMUTT. The path to the mall was intertwined with their rail system with a dizzying amount of verticality, with shops integrating into the rail exits integrating into mall entrances, creating an almost cyberpunk-like feel. There was also much more life and variety in the malls; shops owned by both large chains and small businesses co-existed &amp;ndash; a stark contrast with Singapore&amp;rsquo;s, where rent in large malls (often owned by Capitaland) are too unsustainable for small businesses, pushing them to smaller, less fancy malls at the fringe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not to mention, food here has been both delicious and cheap, with the meals of some days only totalling up to 140 baht (~ S$5.60) &amp;ndash; and that&amp;rsquo;s with both drinks and dessert!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m grateful that I took this opportunity to leave my comfort zone and to have an internship overseas, seeing as how I&amp;rsquo;ve been able to learn so much and experience things that I would never have the chance to in Singapore. The enthusiasm of the people around me in their course of study and fueled my desire to strive to better myself in AI, and I hope to continue learning and working with my new-found friends.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Week 1: Heliconia House</title><link>https://sensura-san.github.io/silly-blog/p/superior-room/</link><pubDate>Sat, 06 Sep 2025 12:12:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sensura-san.github.io/silly-blog/p/superior-room/</guid><description>&lt;img src="https://sensura-san.github.io/silly-blog/week1-kmutt.jpg" alt="Featured image of post Week 1: Heliconia House" /&gt;&lt;h1 id="superior-room--type-i"&gt;Superior Room – Type I
&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;At first the room looked like it might be cramped, but it&amp;rsquo;s actually pretty cozy. The layout is straightforward: a bed, a simple desk, and a little balcony that brings in good light and doubles as a quiet spot. We used the balcony for a small clothes rack — great for drying stuff without taking over the room. The rental cost for this room is 12000 Baht(roughly 486.82 SGD)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall vibe: simple and functional. There&amp;rsquo;s enough storage for the basics and a comfy setup for studying and sleeping — perfect for settling into the semester.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="closet"&gt;Closet
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The closet&amp;rsquo;s on the smaller side, so we ended up sharing and organizing by how often we use things. Stuff that helped:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Slim hangers make a big difference for maximizing rod space.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A small basket for daily accessories keeps the surface clutter-free.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Roll or fold casual clothes to save space on the shelves.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Little tweaks like these make the whole place feel more organized and relaxed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="study-area"&gt;Study Area
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study table was very spacious and became my go‑to spot for working from home. It easily held my laptop, an external monitor, and a few reference books without feeling crowded, so long stretches of focused work were comfortable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What helped make it a proper WFH setup:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lighting: natural light from the balcony plus a small adjustable desk lamp for late nights kept eye fatigue down.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Power &amp;amp; connectivity: a compact power strip and a short cable organizer meant chargers and peripherals were within reach; the campus Wi‑Fi was reliable for video calls.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Organization: a slim drawer caddy and a pen cup kept small items tidy; a dock or USB hub minimized desk clutter.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Comfort &amp;amp; focus: noise‑canceling headphones and a simple routine (clear desk at the end of the day, set hours) made it easier to switch into “work mode.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Small additions like a mouse pad with wrist support, a plant, or a dedicated notebook made the workspace feel personal and productive — a surprisingly good setup for studying and remote work.&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="toilet"&gt;Toilet
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bathroom&amp;rsquo;s fine — nothing fancy. The toilet bowl felt a bit small for me personally, but there’s a water heater, so hot showers are covered. Overall, it does the job.&lt;/p&gt;
