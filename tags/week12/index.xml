&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;For our first stop, we went to Chinatown after our KMITL visit (see prev. post~). After a long bus ride from our lab which took almost an hour (note: avoid Bangkok traffic on Friday..), we entered Chinatown and headed to the Kuan Yim Shrine which is Mahayana Buddhist, to offer some prayers. I sort of only did one and gave up because I was too sleepy, though KM and Khush did properly do the whole three rites.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Afterwards, we headed off for our well-deserved dinner; KM had a place in mind and took the scariest, most long-winded path known to man to reach it. We were joking that he would kidnap us by bringing down a weird alleyway, so when we actually started heading down one, I found myself lowkey concerned&amp;hellip; Anyway, we ended up at a Michelin Bib Gourmand-rated restaurant (surprisingly many in Thailand btw) called Kuay Teow Kua Kai Suan Mali, which served Kuey Teow but fried into a crispy almost pancake-like dish.&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Honestly, I had pretty high expectations of the food quality as I noticed that: a), place was down a dingy alleyway, b), the menu was super tiny, and c), I mean come on its rated by Michelin. Why a) and b) though you may asK? Well, if a restaurant can look run-down yet have loads of customers then the food definitely would make up for it, and if they only make one thing, they&amp;rsquo;d better be pretty damn good at at! And indeed, it was more than above my expectations; when we order the Kuey Teow the skin was delightfully crispy and onsen eggs were absolutely perfect. In a way the fried Kuey Teow skin almost tasted like prata for some reason. Prices were very reasonable too, at 50 THB for small or 60 THB for the large, which is around 2 dollars for them. I uh, had two bowls&amp;hellip; and would&amp;rsquo;ve gotten more if I didn&amp;rsquo;t feel kinda unwell&amp;hellip;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We wrapped up with Khush heading back himself as he lived in the area, whilst the rest of us took a bus back to our dorms to get a good night&amp;rsquo;s rest and prepare for our final day of our internship, and our second last day in thailand~&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;My manager, an undergrad, Andreaa, and I set off for King Mongkut&amp;rsquo;s Institute of Technology Ladkrabang (KMITL) to meet Professor Kitsuchart Pasupa and get a behind-the-scenes look at the SIT campus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We all gathered at Hua Lamphong Railway Station, thanks to my manager’s idea to hop on an old-school train for the full experience. The station itself was massive—seriously, it felt like stepping into a time machine with all the retro vibes.

&lt;figcaption&gt;Hua Lamphong Railway Station&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After strolling through the main entrance, we spotted two trains on display. Not gonna lie, it totally gave off movie vibes—like Mr. Bean’s Holiday with all the chaos at Gare de Lyon in Paris, or those iconic Harry Potter moments at King’s Cross in London. It was a mashup of cinematic nostalgia! And get this—the train fare from Hua Lamphong to KMITL was just 6 Baht. Absolute bargain!

&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The train didn’t have any air conditioning, so we just let the breeze do its thing as we chugged along.

&lt;h2 id="kmitl"&gt;KMITL
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;When we finally arrived at KMITL, we grabbed some lunch before meeting the professors. At the SIT building, students were busy setting up booths for the Open House—which, sadly, was happening the next day, not today&amp;hellip;😭&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;Peace Yo&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once both professors showed up, our campus tour kicked off. The building was pretty unique—six floors, tight hallways, and rooms everywhere you looked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the fourth floor, we stumbled into a game dev room sponsored by Metaverse. There were VR headsets everywhere and some gear that looked like it belonged in a sci-fi movie—think “VR space walk.” Super cool!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;Game Dev Room&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also checked out Professor Kitsuchart Pasupa’s lab to see one of the workstations they use for AI model testing. Fun fact: their “extra” air cooler was just a standing fan!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the tour, two KMUTT students shared their strategies from the recent Cyber AI Cup 2025, where they represented Thailand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Andreaa and I spent the day at the IC2 Lab finalizing deliverables, handing over documentation, and presenting our final updates to the manager. We reviewed outstanding tasks, ensured knowledge transfer, and confirmed next steps before signing off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;After wrapping up and handing over our final materials, Andreaa and I joined the team to celebrate our manager’s birthday — a fitting end to the internship. Professor Jonathan stopped by and brought a cake for everyone; we shared stories, took photos, and thanked everyone for their support. It was a warm, uplifting send‑off that left us proud of what we accomplished and excited for what’s next.&lt;/p&gt;
