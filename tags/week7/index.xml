&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;I had a meeting with Professor Tuul Triyason about which project or research to do that is more related to cybersecurity. He recommended me several ideas, such as building a CTF website for him with heavy topics on web security, and also a network intrusion prevention system comparative analysis. Personally, I was more intrigued by the IPS part because it is something that I have heard before from my past project member. Fortunately, he gave me the task to make a comparative analysis between Suricata and Stratosphere Lab IPS. From here, I started to do my own research on what Stratosphere Lab IPS (SLIPS) and Suricata are. This was where the professor told me to provide him a documentation on how to install and configure SLIPS together with the comparative analysis report.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;Khush and me brainstorm some ideas on what to put in IC2 Homepage. So I came up with an idea to put in more content and images to make the homepage more engaging with parallax design.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Week 7: Makan Place nearby KMUTT</title><link>https://sensura-san.github.io/silly-blog/p/week-seven-blog1/</link><pubDate>Sat, 18 Oct 2025 10:02:15 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sensura-san.github.io/silly-blog/p/week-seven-blog1/</guid><description>&lt;img src="https://sensura-san.github.io/silly-blog/week-seven-cover.jpg" alt="Featured image of post Week 7: Makan Place nearby KMUTT" /&gt;&lt;h1 id="eat-with-bear-a-western-feast-at-kmutts-doorstep"&gt;Eat With Bear: A Western Feast at KMUTT’s Doorstep
&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;The craving for a solid Western meal hit us hard today. While wandering near KMUTT, we were stopped in our tracks by a massive, unmissable bear mascot standing guard outside a storefront. Driven by hunger and curiosity, we decided to check it out.

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We discovered Eat With Bear, and it was exactly what we needed. The moment we stepped inside, we were greeted by a surprisingly spacious and welcoming interior—perfect for hanging out after class.

&lt;p&gt;But the real showstopper? The salad bar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They offer a fantastic variety of fresh greens and toppings. And here is the best part: it’s free-flow. (Note: The unlimited salad bar is complimentary when you order specific main dishes, so check the menu first!)

&lt;p&gt;I decided to go big and ordered the Chicken Burger. &amp;ldquo;Huge&amp;rdquo; is an understatement—this thing was a tower! It came paired with onion rings that were fried to golden perfection—crispy on the outside, tender on the inside, and completely addictive.

&lt;p&gt;If you are near the university and need a burger fix, this is the spot.
