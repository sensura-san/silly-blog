&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;This week, Professor Jonathan introduced us to &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/google-code-golf-2025/overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
&gt;NeurIPS 2025&lt;/a&gt;, a code golf championship intended to create a dataset to improve the performance of LLMs on novel problems. He told us to use the best existing public notebooks, and see how we could improve on any one solution. While to be honest I don&amp;rsquo;t completely see what the purpose of it would be for us, it was nonetheless interesting as I&amp;rsquo;ve always wanted to try my hand at Competitive Programming(-adjacent) problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="navaratri-a-traditional-hindu-festival"&gt;Navaratri, a Traditional Hindu Festival
&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;Khush, whom we met that day, told us about the festival as we were having dinner together alongside Esther, KM, and Fir. Sadly KM had to leave early but for the rest of us we had travelled to go see it via Grab. It was surprisingly cheap at ~25 baht per person (approx. S$1) especially considering that we had to travel all the way to the city area as the festival was held in Silom, taking around 35 minutes. To be fair&amp;hellip; it was split amongst 4 people but still&amp;hellip; unheard of in Singapore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The festival lasts 9 nights, and we had caught it on its final day on Thursday (October 2nd). It was wayyy more packed than I had expected, and in fact more packed last year, according to Khush. It was a very lively celebration indeed, with many of the audience cheerfully chanting to one of the performers balancing a heavy pot (matka) on their heads.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We had to spend a lot of time walking on the curb of the other street which wasn&amp;rsquo;t blocked off for traffic (as the main street was packed to the brim and there were no proper sidewalks there), and it felt pretty dangerous as the cars were passsing by right next to us; perhaps they hadn&amp;rsquo;t anticipated such a massive turnout, there was a lot of traffic jams due to people crossing the road.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, it was really fun and by the end I got to see quite a few different gods and also got to do a offering to one of the many shrines on the side of the road. I found myself completely drenched in sweat due to the humidity from the rain the day before, yet also weirdly energised. By the time we got back, it was already 11PM and I made sure to take a good long shower in order to freshen up.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
