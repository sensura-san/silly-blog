# Superior Room – Type I

At first the room looked like it might be cramped, but it's actually pretty cozy. The layout is straightforward: a bed, a simple desk, and a little balcony that brings in good light and doubles as a quiet spot. We used the balcony for a small clothes rack — great for drying stuff without taking over the room. The rental cost for this room is 12000 Baht(roughly 486.82 SGD)

Overall vibe: simple and functional. There's enough storage for the basics and a comfy setup for studying and sleeping — perfect for settling into the semester.

## Closet

The closet's on the smaller side, so we ended up sharing and organizing by how often we use things. Stuff that helped:
- Slim hangers make a big difference for maximizing rod space.
- A small basket for daily accessories keeps the surface clutter-free.
- Roll or fold casual clothes to save space on the shelves.

Little tweaks like these make the whole place feel more organized and relaxed.

## Study Area

The study table was very spacious and became my go‑to spot for working from home. It easily held my laptop, an external monitor, and a few reference books without feeling crowded, so long stretches of focused work were comfortable.

What helped make it a proper WFH setup:
- Lighting: natural light from the balcony plus a small adjustable desk lamp for late nights kept eye fatigue down.
- Power & connectivity: a compact power strip and a short cable organizer meant chargers and peripherals were within reach; the campus Wi‑Fi was reliable for video calls.
- Organization: a slim drawer caddy and a pen cup kept small items tidy; a dock or USB hub minimized desk clutter.
- Comfort & focus: noise‑canceling headphones and a simple routine (clear desk at the end of the day, set hours) made it easier to switch into “work mode.”

Small additions like a mouse pad with wrist support, a plant, or a dedicated notebook made the workspace feel personal and productive — a surprisingly good setup for studying and remote work.

## Toilet

The bathroom's fine — nothing fancy. The toilet bowl felt a bit small for me personally, but there’s a water heater, so hot showers are covered. Overall, it does the job.
