# Our journey to BKK

# Learning about Projects

Firdaus and I learnt about AI-related projects (which we may be assigned to), such as a makeup recommender that recommends foundationbased on skin colour, and contour based on face shape -- which was classified using AI. It also used facial segmentation image models to apply a filter (e.g. foundation, blush) in order to preview the makeup. Anohter project was that of an AI FAQ chatbot for the school which used RAG. in both, we learnt a bit about the tech stack used for the projects.

KM covered a few of his projects (and those of other students): a time-series regression model to create synthetic data for market conditions (e.g. bull/bear conditions), a past climate change robot -- that used LLMs to spread awareness, and his current research project which is about (Large) Audio Language Models [(L)ALMs].
