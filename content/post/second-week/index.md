# Exploring Projects

Zhi Xuan and I had an opportunity to explore different kinds of projects. One of it is to fix and publish the research papers and publications from the proffessors at IC2 Website. We also were given a suggestion to collaborate with the full-time students and work on their capstone projects.

KM covered a few of his projects (and those of other students): a time-series regression model to create synthetic data for market conditions (e.g. bull/bear conditions), a past climate change robot -- that used LLMs to spread awareness, and his current research project which is about (Large) Audio Language Models [(L)ALMs].
