# Deluxe Room 2 – Type II

We decided to upgrade to a larger room and asked the dorm receptionist about availability. Luckily, there was an open unit that was noticeably bigger than our current place. The price is quite reasonable as the total rent cost for one month for this room is 18000 Baht(roughly 730.23 SGD ) which is an additional 6000 Baht per month from our previous room.

We went for a tour and were pleasantly surprised by how much more spacious it felt — a larger living area, a roomier bedroom, and extra storage that made it easy to separate sleeping, working, and relaxing zones. It immediately felt like a meaningful upgrade in comfort and functionality.

## Living Room

The living room includes a compact kitchenette with a small kitchen table and a dining table placed right beside the study area. That setup makes it easy to work or eat in the living room while keeping the bedroom as a separate, private space. The dining table also doubles as an extra workspace when needed, giving us more surface area and flexibility without crowding the study. The toilet and study table was pretty much the same as last time. Well at least we can work from home!

## Bedroom

Though the bedroom layout gives a familiar “hey, remember this?” vibe from our old place, the upgrade is obvious — we finally have our own closet! Andrea’s side comes with a cheerful stack of shelves that’s already hosting plants, notebooks, snack reserves, and a suspiciously large sock collection. The closet eats my luggage like a polite little black hole and has extra shelves for shoes, boxes, and all those chargers that used to roam free. A string of fairy lights and a cozy rug turned the corner into a tiny chill nook — same cozy bedroom energy, but with actual storage and instant bragging rights.

And since we have our own closet, this time its much more bigger. I can even fit my luggage inside! Additionally, there are several shelves inside the closet to put bunch of your stuff there.

## Balcony

But the most interesting part is our balcony — we’ve got an unobstructed view of the city that completely changes how the place feels. It’s big enough for a small bistro set, so mornings are now for coffee and people-watching, and evenings are for winding down with the skyline. The railing gives a clear sightline without feeling exposed, and a soft string of lights makes it a cosy spot after dark.
