# The One-Hour Wait: Auntie Nid Thai Tea 🥤

This week has been an absolute whirlwind! Andreaa and I took a deep dive into downtown Bangkok, determined to tick a major item off our bucket list: the legendary Auntie Nid Thai Tea.

We arrived to find a massive queue—we’re talking a solid one-hour wait. Thankfully, the shop knows their crowd; they had a line of chairs set up so we didn't have to stand in the heat. But was it worth the wait?

Absolutely. The shocking part wasn't the line; it was the price. For just 1.68 SGD, we got a drink that completely lived up to the hype. Sweet, creamy, and incredibly affordable.

# Dessert Hunting in the University District 🍦

After the tea, we decided to explore the vibrant streets near Chulalongkorn University. This area is buzzing with young adults and is packed with dozens of trendy cafes and restaurants.

We stumbled upon a total hidden gem called Ice Cream Somasorn.

It’s a dedicated dessert cafe that takes sundaes to the next level. We couldn't resist ordering their best-sellers:
* **Banana Crème Brûlée:** Perfectly caramelized and smooth.
* **Kopi Tiramisu:** A rich, coffee-infused delight that hit the spot.

If you are in the area, this is a sweet stop you can't miss.
