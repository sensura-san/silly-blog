# IC2 Publication Page Update

Continuing from last week's work, I used a collapsible content ranging from each year in descending order and pasted all the publications into the respective collapsible contents.

## New Manager in IC2

Professor Jonathan introduced Andreaa and me to the newly joined IC2 Research Manager, Khush Argarwal. It was immediately clear that Khush brings a wealth of experience to the table, exactly the kind of fresh perspective our current project needs! During our brief initial meeting, we discussed the strategic direction for the upcoming quarter. Khush’s background in LLM and Full Stack Development is going to be instrumental in streamlining our workflow. Andreaa and I are particularly excited about his vision for bridging the gap between our theoretical models and practical application. It feels like the start of a very productive chapter for the IC2 team.
