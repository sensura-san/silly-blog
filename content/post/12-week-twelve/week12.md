## Last day at IC2 Lab

Andreaa and I spent the day at the IC2 Lab finalizing deliverables, handing over documentation, and presenting our final updates to the manager. We reviewed outstanding tasks, ensured knowledge transfer, and confirmed next steps before signing off.

## Our Manager's Birthday

After wrapping up and handing over our final materials, Andreaa and I joined the team to celebrate our manager’s birthday — a fitting end to the internship. Professor Jonathan stopped by and brought a cake for everyone; we shared stories, took photos, and thanked everyone for their support. It was a warm, uplifting send‑off that left us proud of what we accomplished and excited for what’s next.
