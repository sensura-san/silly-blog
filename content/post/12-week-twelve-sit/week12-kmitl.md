## Hua Lamphong Railway Station
My manager, one undergraduate student, Andreaa and I went to King Mongkut's Institute of Technology Ladkrabang (KMITL) to meet with Professor Kitsuchart Pasupa to show around the SIT campus. 

At first, we all meet up at Hua Lamphong Railway Station because my manager suggested to try and experience an old school train ride! When we first reached the station, it was so spacious and it kinda give the nostalgia vibes..

After passing through the main door at the middle, we saw two trains for display and not gonna lie, it kinda looks like a mixture of Mr Bean Holiday and Harry Potter! The fare from Hua Lamphong to KMITL was very cheap! It was only 6 Baht!

## Train view

The train has no aircond so we rely on the winds when the train is moving

It took 1 hour to reach to KMITL from Hua Lamphong Railway Station. Along the way, the view was very nice...

## KMITL

Upon reaching KMITL, we had our lunch first before meeting with the professors. When we reached SIT building, there were some students setting up their own booth for Open House which unfortunately not today but the tomorrow...😭

When both professor reached SIT, we started our tour... It was quite unique because the building has 6 floors and compact hallways with multiple rooms.

While touring at level 4, we bumped into this game development room that was sponsored by Metaverse. They have several vr headsets and two equipments that kinda looks like "vr space walk"... Kinda cool...

We also went to Professor Kitsuchart Pasupa lab to see one of the workstation that they used for their AI models testing. Surprisingly enough the additional air cooler is a standing fan!
