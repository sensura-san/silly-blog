## Hua Lamphong Railway Station
My manager, an undergrad, Andreaa, and I set off for King Mongkut's Institute of Technology Ladkrabang (KMITL) to meet Professor Kitsuchart Pasupa and get a behind-the-scenes look at the SIT campus.

We all gathered at Hua Lamphong Railway Station, thanks to my manager’s idea to hop on an old-school train for the full experience. The station itself was massive—seriously, it felt like stepping into a time machine with all the retro vibes.

After strolling through the main entrance, we spotted two trains on display. Not gonna lie, it totally gave off movie vibes—like Mr. Bean’s Holiday with all the chaos at Gare de Lyon in Paris, or those iconic Harry Potter moments at King’s Cross in London. It was a mashup of cinematic nostalgia! And get this—the train fare from Hua Lamphong to KMITL was just 6 Baht. Absolute bargain!

## Train view

The train didn’t have any air conditioning, so we just let the breeze do its thing as we chugged along.

It took about an hour to get from Hua Lamphong to KMITL, but the scenery along the way was honestly pretty awesome.

## KMITL

When we finally arrived at KMITL, we grabbed some lunch before meeting the professors. At the SIT building, students were busy setting up booths for the Open House—which, sadly, was happening the next day, not today...😭

Once both professors showed up, our campus tour kicked off. The building was pretty unique—six floors, tight hallways, and rooms everywhere you looked.

On the fourth floor, we stumbled into a game dev room sponsored by Metaverse. There were VR headsets everywhere and some gear that looked like it belonged in a sci-fi movie—think “VR space walk.” Super cool!

We also checked out Professor Kitsuchart Pasupa’s lab to see one of the workstations they use for AI model testing. Fun fact: their “extra” air cooler was just a standing fan!

After the tour, two KMUTT students shared their strategies from the recent Cyber AI Cup 2025, where they represented Thailand.

They actually took home second place—huge congrats to them!
