# Discussion 

I had a meeting with Professor Tuul Triyason about which project or research to do that is more related to cybersecurity. He recommended me several ideas, such as building a CTF website for him with heavy topics on web security, and also a network intrusion prevention system comparative analysis. Personally, I was more intrigued by the IPS part because it is something that I have heard before from my past project member. Fortunately, he gave me the task to make a comparative analysis between Suricata and Stratosphere Lab IPS. From here, I started to do my own research on what Stratosphere Lab IPS (SLIPS) and Suricata are. This was where the professor told me to provide him a documentation on how to install and configure SLIPS together with the comparative analysis report.


# IC2 Website Update

Khush and me brainstorm some ideas on what to put in IC2 Homepage. So I came up with an idea to put in more content and images to make the homepage more engaging with parallax design.
